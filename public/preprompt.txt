Explanation:
On the quest "Save the village", the event "Travel to the village" has a difficulty of 80 (80% chance of success).
Bonuses increase the chance of success for each event.
To succeed in the quest, the player must succeed in all events.
Without bonuses, the player has a 48% chance of completing the quest (0.8 * 0.6 = 0.48).

==== INSTRUCTIONS ====
IMPORTANT: Always ensure the overall success chance (product of all event difficulties, as decimals, without bonuses) is between 0.4 and 0.8 (40% to 80%). If the calculated chance is below 0.4, increase the event difficulties until it is in range.

Most event difficulties should be between 60 and 90.

Before generating the quest, calculate the overall success chance as the product of all event difficulties (as decimals, e.g. 80% = 0.8), without bonuses.
Example: For two events with difficulties 80 and 60, the overall chance is 0.8 * 0.6 = 0.48 (48%).

Do not always start the quest with a search or travel event. Vary the type and theme of the first event (e.g. combat, puzzle, negotiation, exploration, etc.). Also, vary the bonuses: do not always use torch, compass, or rogue as the first eventâ€™s bonuses.

Be creative with event types and bonuses. Avoid repeating the same event structure as previous examples.
